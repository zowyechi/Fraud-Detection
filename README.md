# Fraud-Detection
This is a supervised learning ML capstone

## In Summary
We have a data that had few samples that we have to enhance using different overfitting techniques before we could enhance and train. We've used different model based and based from all the testing, Random Forest Model works best with the information that we have.

Next steps, I would like to venture on the other data that is provided in the dataset to further test the theory what are the different feature that would cause a transaction to be fraudelous. Also, I want to look into the speed on how long each line takes and look for more effective ways in handling similar type situations.
